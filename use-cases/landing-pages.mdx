## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
  **These kill conversions**
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Too much text">
  ❌ Long paragraphs explaining everything
  
  ✅ Bullet points, short sentences, visuals
  
  **Why:** Users scan, not read. Make it skimmable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Generic stock photos">
  ❌ Fake corporate people shaking hands
  
  ✅ Real product screenshots, actual team photos
  
  **Why:** Authenticity builds trust. Stock photos feel fake.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow loading">
  ❌ Huge uncompressed images, videos autoplay
  
  ✅ Optimized images, lazy loading, fast fonts
  
  **Why:** Every second of delay = 7% conversion loss.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No mobile optimization">
  ❌ Desktop-only layout, tiny buttons
  
  ✅ Mobile-first design, thumb-friendly CTAs
  
  **Why:** 50%+ traffic is mobile. Don't lose half your visitors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Weak headline">
  ❌ "Welcome to our website"
  
  ✅ "Ship AI-Powered Apps in 10 Minutes"
  
  **Why:** You have 3 seconds to hook visitors. Be specific.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hidden pricing">
  ❌ "Contact us for pricing"
  
  ✅ Transparent pricing tiers upfront
  
  **Why:** Transparency builds trust. Hidden pricing feels shady.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
