      - Layout priorities: "make the CTA button prominent"

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build is taking longer than 15 minutes">
    **Possible causes:**

    - Complex app with many features
    - Database provisioning (adds 2-3 min)
    - First-time setup

    **What to do:**

    - Check the chat for progress updates
    - If stuck for 20+ minutes, contact support
    - Most builds complete in 10-15 min
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="App doesn't look as expected">
    **What to try:**

    - Be more specific in your next message
    - Share a link to design inspiration: "Make it look like stripe.com"
    - Request specific changes: "Make the hero section bolder"

    **Remember:** AI improves with feedback!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Feature is missing">
    **What to do:**

    - Chat: "Add [feature name]"
    - Check task suggestions (AI might recommend it)
    - Break complex features into smaller tasks

    **Example:** Instead of "Add complete user dashboard", try:

    1. "Add user profile page"
    2. "Add settings page"
    3. "Add activity feed"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't connect my own Supabase">
    **Common issues:**

    1. Wrong URL format (should be `https://xxx.supabase.co`)
    2. Wrong API key (use anon key, not service role)
    3. RLS policies blocking access

    **Solution:** Follow the [database connection guide](/features#database-options)
  </Accordion>
