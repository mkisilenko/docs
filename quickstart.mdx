## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Build is taking longer than 15 minutes">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Complex app with many features
  - Database provisioning (adds 2-3 min)
  - First-time setup
  
  **What to do:**
  - Check the chat for progress updates
  - If stuck for 20+ minutes, contact support
  - Most builds complete in 10-15 min
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="App doesn't look as expected">
  **What to try:**
  - Be more specific in your next message
  - Share a link to design inspiration: "Make it look like stripe.com"
  - Request specific changes: "Make the hero section bolder"
  
  **Remember:** AI improves with feedback!
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Feature is missing">
  **What to do:**
  - Chat: "Add [feature name]"
  - Check task suggestions (AI might recommend it)
  - Break complex features into smaller tasks
  
  **Example:** Instead of "Add complete user dashboard", try:
  1. "Add user profile page"
  2. "Add settings page"
  3. "Add activity feed"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't connect my own Supabase">
  **Common issues:**
  1. Wrong URL format (should be `https://xxx.supabase.co`)
  2. Wrong API key (use anon key, not service role)
  3. RLS policies blocking access
  
  **Solution:** Follow the [database connection guide](/features#database-options)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
