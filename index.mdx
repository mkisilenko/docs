## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Describe your app">
  Type your idea in plain English. Be specific about features, style, and audience.
  
  ```
  "Create a landing page for my AI writing assistant. 
  Dark mode, modern design, hero with demo video, 
  pricing tiers, customer testimonials."
  ```
  
  <Tip>The more detail you provide, the better the result</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="AI agents build it">
  Our autonomous agents:
  - Design the UI (modern, responsive)
  - Write production-ready code (React, TypeScript)
  - Set up database (if needed)
  - Add intelligent AI features
  - Create GitHub repo
  - Deploy to production
  
  **All in 10-15 minutes**
</Step>

<Step title="Refine via chat">
  Not perfect? Just chat to iterate:
  
  - "Make the hero section bolder"
  - "Add a pricing calculator"
  - "Change to blue color scheme"
  
  AI agents implement changes and redeploy automatically.
  
  <Check>Your app evolves with every message</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>
