    "Similar to stripe.com - clean, professional, blue/white"

    "Like airbnb.com - image-heavy, trust-building"
    
    **Why it works:** AI understands popular sites
  </Card>
  <Card title="Style Keywords" icon="palette">
    "Modern and bold" → Strong shadows, large whitespace

    "Playful and fun" → Rounded corners, vibrant colors
    
    **Why it works:** Clear visual personality

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Too vague">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Over-specified">
    ❌ "Use #FF5733 for all buttons, #3357FF for headers, 18px Helvetica,

    cool blue accents. Professional tech feel."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflicting references">
    ❌ "Make it look like Apple's website but also like Netflix 
    and add animations like Stripe"

    **Problems:** Conflicting references, unclear direction

## Prompting Principles

### 1. Be Specific, Not General

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ General" icon="x">
    "Make it look modern"

    **Problem:** "Modern" means different things
  </Card>
  <Card title="✅ Specific" icon="check">
    "Modern = clean sans-serif fonts, lots of white space, subtle shadows, smooth animations"

    **Better:** Descriptive details
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Use Design References

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Abstract" icon="x">
    "Professional corporate design"

    **Problem:** Too subjective
  </Card>
  <Card title="✅ Concrete" icon="check">
    "Corporate style like stripe.com - clean, blue/white, lots of breathing room"

    **Better:** Real website reference
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Provide Content, Not Placeholders

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Lazy" icon="x">
    "Add some testimonials"

    **Problem:** Generic placeholder content
  </Card>
  <Card title="✅ Thoughtful" icon="check">
    "Testimonials:

    - 'Saved us 10 hours/week' - Sarah Chen, Marketing Lead at Acme
    - 'Game changer for our team' - John Smith, CEO of StartupCo"

    **Better:** Real quotes that sell
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 4. Break Down Complex Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Overwhelming" icon="x">
    "Add complete user management with roles, permissions, team invites, billing, and admin dashboard"

    **Problem:** Too much at once
  </Card>
  <Card title="✅ Incremental" icon="check">
    First prompt: "Add user authentication (signup, login, logout)"

    Next: "Add team invites via email"

    Next: "Add role-based permissions (admin, member)"

    **Better:** One feature at a time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Unstuck

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AI misunderstood me">
    **What to do:**

    - Rephrase with more details
    - Provide a visual reference (link to similar site)

    **Example:** Instead of "Make it more modern", try: "Update to use: larger font sizes, more white space, subtle shadows, smooth scroll animations"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Not happy with the design">
    **What to try:**

    - Share a link: "Make it look more like stripe.com"
    - Be specific: "Increase heading size by 50%, add blue gradient to hero"
    - Try a new direction: "Let's pivot to a darker, more mysterious vibe"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Feature isn't working">
    **Steps:**

    1. Describe the issue: "The contact form doesn't send emails"
    2. AI will debug and fix
    3. If stuck, break it down: "First, let's just get the form to submit"
