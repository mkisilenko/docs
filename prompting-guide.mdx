## Before & After Examples

  ```
  
  **Problems:**

## Prompting Principles

### 1. Be Specific, Not General

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ General" icon="x">
    "Make it look modern"
    
    **Problem:** "Modern" means different things
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="✅ Specific" icon="check">
    "Modern = clean sans-serif fonts, lots of white space, subtle shadows, smooth animations"
    
    **Better:** Descriptive details
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Use Design References

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Abstract" icon="x">
    "Professional corporate design"
    
    **Problem:** Too subjective
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="✅ Concrete" icon="check">
    "Corporate style like stripe.com - clean, blue/white, lots of breathing room"
    
    **Better:** Real website reference
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Provide Content, Not Placeholders

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Lazy" icon="x">
    "Add some testimonials"
    
    **Problem:** Generic placeholder content
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="✅ Thoughtful" icon="check">
    "Testimonials:
    - 'Saved us 10 hours/week' - Sarah Chen, Marketing Lead at Acme
    - 'Game changer for our team' - John Smith, CEO of StartupCo"
    
    **Better:** Real quotes that sell
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 4. Break Down Complex Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Overwhelming" icon="x">
    "Add complete user management with roles, permissions, team invites, billing, and admin dashboard"
    
    **Problem:** Too much at once
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="✅ Incremental" icon="check">
    First prompt: "Add user authentication (signup, login, logout)"
    
    Next: "Add team invites via email"
    
    Next: "Add role-based permissions (admin, member)"
    
    **Better:** One feature at a time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Unstuck

<Tabs>
<Tab title="AI misunderstood me">
  **What to do:**
  - Rephrase with more details
  - Provide a visual reference (link to similar site)
  - Break request into smaller parts
  
  **Example:**
  Instead of "Make it more modern", try:
  "Update to use: larger font sizes, more white space, subtle shadows, smooth scroll animations"
</Tab>

<Tab title="Not happy with the design">
  **What to try:**
  - Share a link: "Make it look more like stripe.com"
  - Be specific: "Increase heading size by 50%, add blue gradient to hero"
  - Try a new direction: "Let's pivot to a darker, more mysterious vibe"
</Tab>

<Tab title="Feature isn't working">
  **Steps:**
  1. Describe the issue: "The contact form doesn't send emails"
  2. AI will debug and fix
  3. If stuck, break it down: "First, let's just get the form to submit"
</Tab>
